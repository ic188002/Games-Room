# Project-1

<h1> TTT </h1>
<h2> Tic Tac Toe </h2>
<br>
<p> What I used
JavaScript, Jquery, CSS and HTML

A current user,  In want to play TTT, so I can pass the time
As a current user, I want to interact with the site, so I can change the surrounding
As a user, I want to play with my kids, two player is always better
As a user, I want to be taken away from the typical video game experience, so that I can try something new
As a user, I want to be shown that I won and my kid lost, to show them who’s boss

In this project I wanted to practice and prefect the javascript functionality that we have learned about, at the start of this project I was struggling with to understand the cause and effect functionality of javascript, which led me to break down all of the functions, after a mixture of looking back over the notes and some online help has lead me to this. 

For the actual website I wanted to full utilise my skill sets, having studied design I wanted to create a unique and interesting interactive website. Having decided on a theme for the site which is a child’s and well; also properly currently mine work page with doodles and drawings flowing throughout, I also wanted the doodle to interactive without using one imagination! 

I enjoyed working within the HTML and CSS folders for the first couple of days creating the desired design, which left only the functionality of the site two tackle.  Having looked at examples online I gaged how to break down each sector in JS and focus on one step at a time. 


What I want to fix

One the gun game the screen moves past the point taking the view portal with it.

My favourite function is the change player function

This is called user function and it changes the class after each turn, first it runs an IF statement and will proceed if two conditions are met, that its a valid function and that the tile is active. Then  it trigger the 3 main paths of java, it updates the board, it check is there is a winner or not and then it will change the player!
